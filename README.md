### Photomosaic
It is a python project that reconstructs an image by juxtaposing, like a mosaic, a large number of much smaller images, chosen for their adequate average color. 


### How to execute ???
That's a little bit a pain in the ass, it was one on my first project with python. So I din't create class and everything.

- First, you have to resize all your picture in your DataBase. You have to use the file resize.py and put your own path to your DataBase.
- Then you have to rename your DataBase, with the file rename.py. Ok I admit, this not the best way to do it, i create this function to call all the picture whithin the dataBase. You can do better with some other technique (os.listdir() chuut !!)

- Well you nearly at the end mate, when you done with creating all your path/DataBase. You can execute the main proagram call : main.py.


### Let's see the result
